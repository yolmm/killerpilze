##  1. <a name='Introduction'></a> Introduction

An application to filter wherever ingredient you want to see it at a glance in the ingredients' list of a product.

##  2. <a name='Motivation'></a> Motivation

I'm allergic to mushrooms, so I always pay a lot of attention to the ingredients' list when I buy any product at the grocery store because mushrooms aren't a major food allergen. I would like to stop loosing so much time looking for mushrooms, specially if the product doesn't have any.

Also, I'm  trying to learn Python and I think the best way to learn a new language is programming something interesting.
